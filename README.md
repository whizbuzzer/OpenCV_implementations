# Computer Vision operations using OpenCV
#### by Aniket N Prabhu

This project aims to accomplish certain basic computer vision related operations using the OpenCV library. The operations are described below. For a better documentation, check the pdf file in the repository.

### Operations

- Pinhole camera model and calibration
- Stereo calibration and rectification
- Sparse depth triangulation
- Dense depth triangulation

The file hierarchy has been described below:

```sh
.
├── code              # contains code related to the operations
│   ├── task_1        # Pinhole camera model and calibration
│   ├── task_2        # Stereo calibration and rectification
│   ├── task_3        # Sparse depth triangulation
│   └── task_4        # Dense depth triangulation
├── images            # Required images/data
│   ├── task_1
│   ├── task_2
│   └── task_3_and_4
├── output            # Results
│   ├── task_1
│   ├── task_2
│   ├── task_3
│   └── task_4
└── parameters        # Output parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic matrices, etc.)
```
